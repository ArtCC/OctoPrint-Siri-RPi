## Use OctoPrint with Siri and shortcuts with a Raspberry Pi and Node.js

With this project you will be able to control your 3D printer if you use OctoPrint as a print server with Siri from your iOS device, iPadOS, macOS or HomePod using the Apple Shortcuts.

You will need a Raspberry Pi (you can use the same one you use OctoPrint on) with Node.js installed.

After following my tutorial you will be able to control by voice and Siri your 3D printer.

I'm an iOS developer and this project came to my mind because of being at home quarantined by the COVID-19 virus.

I hope you like the project, I'm open to all kind of help and modifications.

Thank you very much!

Arturo.
